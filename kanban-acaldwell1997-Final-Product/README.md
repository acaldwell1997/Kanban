# DWS2 Kanban Board

Welcome to the starter repo for your Kanban board application ðŸš€!

You'll want to customize this readme file a bit to contain information about the project, but for now here is what you need to know to get set up:

## Installation

Make sure you have the following:

- Node (v11)
- NPM

From the root of this project run: `npm install`. This will pull in the dependencies needed for development.

## Usage

- `npm start`: This command will start up a local web server, open your default browser, and begin watching scss files for changes.
- `npm run build`: This command will only compile your scss files.
- `Launch`: When opening the project folder, you'll want to click "index" to launch the application
- `Color Settings`: The "color settings" button allows you to change the banner color of the application. Once clicking on the button, you'll be shown several colors to choose from. Upon clicking a color, the banner will update reflecting the color selected. If you change your mind, you can easily select "cancel" or click the "color settings" button again to revert back to your original color. If you like the new color, click "done" and the page will be updated with your chosen color!
- `Adding a Task`: Each section has an "add" button. When clicking this button, you will be presented with a form. The title is a required field, everything else is optional. Once completing the form, click "submit" to save your task. If you would like to clear the current data in the fields, click "reset", or if you completely change your mind, click "cancel".

## Things to know

You can customize the structure of this project however you like. A base set of functionality has been provided to get you started. Make sure to familiarize yourself with what's going on in the `gulpfile.js`.
